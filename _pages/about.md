I am a Ph.D student at University of Wisconsin-Madison majoring in Computer Science. Presently, I am working as a research assistant in [Wi-Pi Lab](https://wiscprivacy.com).I got my B.Tech and M.Tech in Engineering Physics (with specialization in Nanoscience) in Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay. After that, I started my graduate school in 2016 with research in Neutrino Physics where I worked on the [Askaryan Radio Array](https://ara.wipac.wisc.edu). The experiment is located at the geographic South Pole where the ultra high energy neutrinos interact with the ice and generate radio signal. Over the years, my interests started to shift towards computer science and I realized that I was interested in Natural Language Processing and it's applications in Privacy research. Soon after that, I switched to the graduate program in Computer Science. You can find more about my research [here](/research)

My hometown is Jaipur, India; also known as the pink city due it's trademark building color. Apart from research, I am interested in cooking, in particular experimenting with new recipes and adding an Indian twist (mostly just adding the spices that I like) to them. I also enjoy several sports like Cricket, Volleyball and all Racquet sports.
